                    Virtual Quake has become the standard fault system simulator code for California and it is the most widely used. It is now maintained by the NSF-supported Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics ( <a href="http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/vq/" target="_blank">CIG</a>). In the first four months after being released on CIG, it was downloaded more than 170 times by users on all continents (except Antarctica). Virtual Quake will be one of the two earthquake simulators used to analyze the recently released UCERF3 fault model for California, the standard California fault system produced by the USGS. Furthermore, in 2012 Virtual California — as a member of the QuakeSim team — was co-winner of NASA’s Software of the Year award.
                    
                    
                    Virtual Quake (VQ) is a boundary element code that models the earthquake fault system in California. VQ is designed to explore the statistics of seismicity in today's fault system by simulating stress interactions between faults. In a simulation, the faults slowly creep at the geologically observed rates and earthquakes are triggered by the stress on individual faults reaching the critical value, determined by known scaling relations. During the rupture (earthquake) faults slip and release accumulated stress.

                    <p class="text-left"> The simulation output relevant to computing earthquake probabilities are the recurrance times, or the time between successive earthquakes on a given fault. We can take these recurrence times from the simulation output compute the cumulative probability distribution for an earthquake on the specified faults. From this distribution we can also compute the expected waiting times until the next earthquake, as a function of the time since the last large earthquake. The Virtual Quake computed earthquake probabilities and waiting times are given for Northern and Southern California at the links below.

This is not a time dependent evolution of the gravity field, but is a "slideshow" of co-seismic gravity changes for all earthquakes in the time frame.

The majority of the events are strike-slip faults (plate motion is similar to rubbing two bricks together on their long edge) and have a characteristic butterfly pattern in the gravity signal.
